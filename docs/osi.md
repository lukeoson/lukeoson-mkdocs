### What is the OSI Model?

| Layer Number | Layer Name      | Function                                                                 | Examples                              |
|--------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 7            | Application     | Provides network services directly to applications                       | HTTP, FTP, SMTP                       |
| 6            | Presentation    | Translates data between the network and application formats              | SSL, TLS, JPEG, MPEG                  |
| 5            | Session         | Manages sessions between applications                                    | NetBIOS, RPC                          |
| 4            | Transport       | Provides reliable data transfer                                          | TCP, UDP                              |
| 3            | Network         | Handles addressing and routing of data packets                           | IP, ICMP, IPSec                       |
| 2            | Data Link       | Transfers data between network and physical layers                       | Ethernet, PPP, Switch, Bridge         |
| 1            | Physical        | Deals with the physical connection to the network, data transmission    | Cables, Hubs, Repeaters, Network Cards|




### How does the OSI Reference Model relate to TCP/IP?

| Layer Number | Layer Name   | Function                                                | Examples                                |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 4            | Application  | Handles high-level protocols, representation, encoding | HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS                    |
| 3            | Transport    | Manages end-to-end data transmission                    | TCP, UDP                                |
| 2            | Internet     | Determines the best path through the network            | IP (IPv4, IPv6), ICMP                   |
| 1            | Network Access (or Link) | Deals with the physical aspects of data transmission  | Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ARP                    |
