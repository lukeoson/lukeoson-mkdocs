### What is Hexadecimal?

- **Made of 16 Symbols**: Hexadecimal uses a set of 16 unique symbols to represent values. These symbols include 0-9 and the letters A-F.

- **More User-Friendly Than Binary**: While binary represents data with only two symbols (0 and 1), hexadecimal's use of 16 symbols makes it more compact and user-friendly for representing large binary values.

- **Base-16 Numbering System**: Hexadecimal is a base-16 system. This means that each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16, in contrast to the base-10 system we use in everyday life.

- **Binary is Base-2**: In comparison, binary is a base-2 system, where each digit represents a power of 2. This makes binary the fundamental language of computers, but it can be lengthy and complex for human interpretation.

- **Decimal is Base-10**: The decimal system, which is the most familiar numbering system for daily use, is a base-10 system. It uses ten symbols (0-9) and each digit represents a power of 10.
