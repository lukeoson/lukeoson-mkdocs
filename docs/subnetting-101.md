??? note "No Worries"

    üîï **Do not be alarmed.** Most people use a subnet calculator in the real world. üòå

    - [x] Here is my go to [Visual Subnet Calc](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html?network=).

    - [x] But it is handy to know the basic theory. ‚êÜ


## IP Classes

---

- [x] **Class A**: Large networks, 0-126.

- 0xxxxxxx | First bit is OFF. 

---

- [x] **Class B**: Medium networks, 128-191.

- 10xxxxxx | First bit is ON, Second bit is OFF.

---

- [x] **Class C**: Small networks, 192-223.

- 110xxxxx | First two bits are ON, Third bit is OFF.

---

- [x] **Class D**: Multicast groups, 224-239.

- 1110xxxx | First three bits are ON, Fourth bit is OFF.

---

- [x] **Class E**: Experimental use, 240-255.

- 1111xxxx | First four bits are ON.

| Class | Leading Bits   | Range of First Octet |
|-------|----------------|----------------------|
| A     | 0xxxxxxx       | 0 - 127              |
| B     | 10xxxxxx       | 128 - 191            |
| C     | 110xxxxx       | 192 - 223            |
| D     | 1110xxxx       | 224 - 239            |
| E     | 1111xxxx       | 240 - 255            |

#### Subnets
- [x] **Subnet Masks**: Define network/host portions.
- [x] **VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Mask)**: Flexible subnet sizing.
- [x] **SUM (Supernetting)**: Combine smaller networks.

### All Zeros and All Ones

**Network Address (All Host Bits Off - 0s):**

- [x] When all the host bits are set to 0, the address represents the network address. 

- [x] This address is not assignable to individual devices but is used to identify the network or subnet itself. 

- [x] In a subnet 192.168.1.0/24, the address 192.168.1.0 is the network address, where the last octet (1.**0**) has all host bits off.
**

**Broadcast Address (All Host Bits On - 1s):**

- [x] When all the host bits are set to 1, the address becomes the broadcast address for that subnet. 
- [x] This address is used to send data to all devices on the subnet simultaneously. 
- [x] It's like a shout-out to everyone on that network. 
- [x] In the same subnet 192.168.1.0/24, the broadcast address would be 192.168.1.255, where the last octet (1.**255**) has all host bits on.

| Host Bits Status | Address Type      | Description                                                |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| All 0s           | Network Address   | The address used to identify the subnet itself.            |
| All 1s           | Broadcast Address | The address used to send data to all hosts on the subnet.  |

### Why Minimize Broadcast Packets?

Minimizing broadcast packets helps maintain a smoother, faster, and more secure network. It's like keeping public announcements in a big building to only the floors that need to hear them, rather than blasting them everywhere!
