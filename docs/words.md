??? note "Understanding Word Types and Language Concepts *...In case you are as dumb and forgetful as me.* üòÖ"

    ### Types of Words

    - **Noun**: A word that represents a person, place, thing, or idea. For example, *tree*, *computer*, or *freedom*.
    - **Verb**: A word that denotes action or a state of being. For example, *run*, *think*, or *exist*.
    - **Adjective**: A word that describes or modifies a noun. For example, *happy*, *blue*, or *fast*.
    - **Adverb**: A word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb, often specifying how, when, or where something happens. For example, *quickly*, *very*, or *here*.
    - **Pronoun**: A word used in place of a noun to avoid repetition. For example, *he*, *she*, *it*, or *they*.
    - **Preposition**: A word that shows relationships between other words, often indicating location or time. For example, *in*, *on*, *before*, or *after*.
    - **Conjunction**: A word used to connect clauses or sentences. For example, *and*, *but*, or *because*.
    - **Interjection**: A word or phrase that expresses emotion or exclamation. For example, *wow!*, *ouch!*, or *oh no!*.

    ### Language Concepts

    - **Semantics**: The study of meaning in language. Semantics focuses on how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning.
        - Example: The word *bank* can refer to the side of a river or a financial institution, depending on the context.

    - **Grammar**: The set of rules that govern the structure of sentences in a language, including word order, tense, and punctuation. Proper grammar helps ensure that language is clear and consistent.
        - Example: *He goes to the store* follows grammatical rules, while *He go to store* does not.

    - **Syntax**: The arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences in a language. Syntax refers to the structure of sentences and how different parts of speech are ordered.
        - Example: *The cat sat on the mat* follows English syntax, while *Sat on the mat the cat* does not.

    ### Why This Matters
