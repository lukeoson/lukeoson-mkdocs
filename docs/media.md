# My Favorite Media

Here you will find the media I consume routinely that informs my worldview. Content that inspires, educates, and entertains me. 

In an unrelentingly information rich, complex and polarized world, I try to consume a wide variety of perspectives and ideas. 

My aim in providing this curated content portfolio is to grant you some modicum of insight into the influences that shape my opinions. 

To be clear, I actively seek out diverse viewpoints that challenge my beliefs. This is foundational to my growth.

Any attempt to put me in a ideological box is futile. Please refrain from drawing and radical or definitive conclusions. But feel free to use this page as a frame of reference for understanding the type of person I am.

I'm more curious than clever. But remain committed to continuously iterating my knowledge and understanding of our wondrous world.

My hope is you will get some gist of the type of person I am through the media I share here. But that you will also instintively recognize there is much nuance to everyone. We all have multitudes.
