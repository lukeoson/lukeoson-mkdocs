# My Favorite Media

Here you'll find the media I consume routinely that informs my worldview. Content that inspires, educates, and entertains me. In an information rich, complex, and polarized world, I try to consume a wide variety of perspectives and ideas. 

!!! warning 
    My aim in providing this curated content portfolio is to provide you some modicum of insight into the influences that shape my opinions. To be clear, I actively seek out diverse viewpoints that challenge my beliefs. This is basic tenant of knowledge. Any attempt to box me up ideologically is futile. Please refrain from drawing any radical or definitive conclusions. But feel free to use this page as a frame of reference for understanding the type of person I am.

I'm more curious than clever. But remain committed to continuously iterating my knowledge and understanding of our wondrous world. My hope is you will get the gist of the kind of person I am through the media I consume. But that you will also instinctively accept there is much nuance to everyone. We all have multitudes. And it's turtles all the way down.
