My own opinion is that belief is the death of intelligence. *Robert Anton Wilson.*

Because this is love, kid, and it’s all yours. Believe me, you're in for one hell of a ride, after all--this is the one thing I know for sure. *Beau Taplin.*

---

> The world is not divided between East & West. You are American, I am Iranian, we don't know each other, but we talk and we understand each other perfectly.
