## Introduction

In network management and infrastructure, maintaining accurate and up-to-date information is crucial. This is the concept of a **Source of Truth (SoT)**. An SoT serves as the authoritative repository for a particular network data context, ensuring consistency, reliability, and accessibility across tools and teams. It's a foundational construct to building automated networks that scale with integrity. You can't get much done without it so it's appropriate to prioritise the SoT component of your network architecture strategy.
