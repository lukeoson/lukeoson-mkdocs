# Affinity symbol set
Free 2D symbols for computer network diagrams. 

## Why?
Simple. I wanted modern, crisp, pixel-perfect, printable, manufacturer independent symbols for computer-network topology that does not look like they were made in the 80s. 

## Want to change color?
`sed -e "s/rgb(77,77,77)/rgb(45,103,185)/" c_shield_gray.svg > c_shield_blue.svg`
