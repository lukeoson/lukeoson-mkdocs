|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Generation    | Data is generated or requested by an application. |
| 2. Encapsulation | Data is encapsulated into packets with headers.   |
| 3. Transmission  | Packets are transmitted over the network.         |
| 4. Routing       | Routers forward packets based on destination.    |
| 5. Switching     | Switches forward packets within local networks.   |
| 6. Arrival       | Packets arrive at their destination.              |
| 7. Decapsulation | Packets are decapsulated to retrieve data.       |
| 8. Delivery      | Data is delivered to the destination app.        |
